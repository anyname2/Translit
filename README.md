Translit

This app will start automatically on Windows startup as a service.

App will start converting letters only when Russian keyboard layout is active.

If you manually disabled converting, it will become active again, when you switch to Russian keyboard layout.

To stop converting you should do one of the following:

        1) Switch to different keyboard layout,
        2) Press pause/break key.


Tested on Windows 8 x64 and Windows 8.1 x64.
